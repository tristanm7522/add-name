## About Me

#### Who am I?
My name is **Tristan Molina** and I am a **_proud_** student of sep11.
I am a junior or 11th grader in the _High School of Telecommunications of Arts and Technology_

#### Why am I interested in Software Engineering?
I have always loved phones, video games and computers. When I was very young I always felt I had a big passion for anything computerized. I used to watch movies with people doing big fast coding with cool colors like in the matrix. My grandfather was a really smart engineer and taught me a lot. Now I'm in high school and was presented with such an amazing opportunity to learn about and do even more with computers and robots through this SEP. My teacher Mr. Mueller teaches us so much and is really involved with Software Engineering. Mr. Mueller provides us with great lessons that helped me do what I can today. This is my third year in this program and although there were tough times where I got lost or didn't know how to do something I learned and created amazing things. I hope to land a job as a software engineer since I am pretty good at it and computers are the future and I know that it would grant me many rewards in the future so I plan to continue on my path and see where I land.
